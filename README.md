# Sparkworks wasm

A wasm version of [yumaikas' Sparkworks](https://github.com/yumaikas/LispGameJamAutumn2021)

## Overview

The current approach is to build a small program that embeds [janet](https://janet-lang.org) and is linked to [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).  The program loads and executes Sparkworks, a game written by [yumaikas](https://github.com/yumaikas) in Janet that uses Raylib via jaylib.

The program is made executable in a web browser by being compiled by [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

The goal of this demo is to produce appropriate `.wasm`, `.js`, `.html`, and related files and then to test their functionality via a web browser.  Before compilation via Emscripten can take place, some pieces need to be prepared:

* `main.c` - the aforementioned small program
* `janet.c` + support files - for embedding janet
* `libraylib.a` - "HTML5-ready" Raylib static library
* `resources` - a directory containing Sparkworks bits

## Prerequisites

* Emscripten 3.1.3 (other versions might work)
* Usual build tools
* Janet

## Steps

* Ensure repository has been cloned recursively:
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/sogaiu/sparkworks-wasm
    ```

* For *nixen, with emsdk under `~/src/emsdk`:
    ```
    source ~/src/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
    janet build-unix.janet
    ```

* For Windows, with emsdk in a sibling directory of this repository (likely need to do via a Native Tools Command Prompt):
    ```
    ..\emsdk\emsdk_env.bat
    janet build-windows.janet
    ```

* Start a web server to serve the built files:

    For a machine with python3, that might be:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server --directory public
    ```

* Try out the results:

    Visit http://localhost:8000 and click on `main.html`
